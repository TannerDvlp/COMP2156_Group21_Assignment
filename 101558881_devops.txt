Comp2156 Devops is a course where students learn about software development and information technology operations. 
As of week 6 we have been doing labs based on github and working with repositories. 
We have done things such as creating branches, creating workflows and working with CI.yml files. 
In our lectures we learnt the different responiblities a devops are responsible for. 
We learnt things such as the devops life cycle. 
Our most recent work we've done is this group project we are currently doing. 
This group assignment involves working with others as we work on our own branches and then merge it after.
